What's this project ?
======================

A PHP script who analyse the user agent and define the browser name, the browser version and the plateform.


Why should I use this script ?
======================

To save execution time ! It's faster to make a regex on a string than use a "database" like the file browscap.ini


Limit of the concept
======================

This script will only give you few information about the browser. If you need to know more like browser capabilities, you should check for another project like the <a href="https://github.com/GaretJax/phpbrowscap">Browscap project</a> for example.

Known issue
======================
This script do not detect IE11. Feel free to pull a request if you know how to fix it.

Sources
======================
I found a pice of code <a href="http://www.silverphp.com/how-to-get-browser-and-operating-system-information-with-php.html">here</a> and <a href="http://www.kingofdevelopers.com/php-classes/get-browser-name-version.php">here</a>.
I don't know who wrote-it first.
